I'm currently leveling up at **Quantrail Data**, where I'm crafting scalable **ETL pipelines**, tuning complex queries in **ClickHouse**, and learning the ropes of production-ready data engineering. Fresh out of my Computer Science degree, I’m diving deep into building **robust, efficient, and high-throughput data infra**.

Recently, I wrapped up a project called **TrendLite** – a real-time retail insights dashboard built with `ClickHouse` & `Streamlit`. It started as a way to lock in my ClickHouse skills post-Udemy, but it turned into a super fun, real-time analytics playground. Learned a ton about query optimization, large dataset handling, and fast aggregation.

Here are a few other cool things I’ve built along the way:

* ⚡ **AutoTrend** – an AutoML-powered demand prediction engine with ensemble models & dynamic dashboards
* 💊 **MedRem** – a hackathon-winning app for smart medicine tracking and reminders
* 🧠 **Pictale** – a productivity tools suite designed during HackOverflow
* 🏁 Hackathon enthusiast – competed in TechQuest, HackOverflow, and more (I live for the late-night caffeine & code jams!)
