Gotcha da — you want to highlight **TrendLite** as a solid personal initiative, not a show-off "featured project." Here’s a clean, accurate version that naturally brings it up without sounding too promotional:

<h1 align="left">Hey there 👋, I'm Hussain</h1>  
<p align="left">🚀 Associate Data Engineer | Python & SQL Specialist | ClickHouse Enthusiast</p>

I'm currently working with the amazing folks at **Quantrail Data**, building scalable **ETL pipelines**, optimizing queries in **ClickHouse**, and diving into production-grade data infra.
I’ve completed my Computer Science degree, and now I’m fully focused on sharpening my data engineering skills through real work and side projects.

Recently, I wrapped up a project called **TrendLite**, a real-time retail insights dashboard using `ClickHouse` and `Streamlit`.
I built it right after finishing a ClickHouse course — mainly to solidify what I learned and explore how ClickHouse performs with real-time analytics. Learned a ton from it!

Some other cool things I’ve worked on:

* ⚡ **AutoTrend** – AutoML-based demand prediction with model comparison and ensemble learning
* 💊 **MedRem** – a 24-hour hackathon web app for medicine tracking and reminders
* 🧠 **Pictale** – productivity tools built during HackOverflow
* 🏁 Hackathon head – been to TechQuest, HackOverflow, and love the late-night grind
