<h1 align="left">Hey there 👋, I'm Hussain</h1>  
<p align="left">🚀 Associate Data Engineer | Python & SQL Enthusiast | ClickHouse Explorer</p>

---

I'm currently working with the amazing folks at **Quantrail Data**, building scalable **ETL pipelines**, optimizing queries in **ClickHouse**, and diving into production-grade data infra.  
I’ve completed my Computer Science degree and am now focused on sharpening my data engineering skills through real-world work and side projects.

Recently, I wrapped up a project called **TrendLite** — a real-time retail insights dashboard using `ClickHouse` and `Streamlit`.  
I built it right after finishing the ClickHouse course from Udemy — mainly to solidify what I learned and explore how ClickHouse performs with real-time analytics. Learned a ton from it!

Here are a few other things I’ve built:

* ⚡ **AutoTrend** – AutoML-based demand prediction with model comparison & ensemble learning  
* 💊 **MedRem** – 24-hour hackathon app for medicine tracking and smart reminders  
* 🧠 **Pictale** – productivity tools suite built during HackOverflow  
* 🏁 Hackathon regular – been to TechQuest, HackOverflow, and love the late-night grind
